# Improved Calculator Example
# Use split( ) to process user input.
# Here are the requirements written from a user perspective:
# "I need a simple application that takes user entry in the following format:
# <operation> <first number>,<second number>
# The operation can be either "add" or "subtract".
# The application must do the arithmetic and return the answer in the format:
# The answer is <answer>
# The application does not need to loop. It must execute once and then terminate."
