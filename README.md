# IT5016D Research Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my research repository, where I've shared my Python experiments and insights.  
Join me as I embark on Python programming in this repository, reflecting my coding progress.

## Repository Structure

Navigate my neatly organised coding expedition directory, where you'll find folders for various modules and topics.

## Code Collections

In this section, you'll discover code pieces, tied to the modules and the ones that inspired me throughout of my learning journey.

### Exploring A Bit...

Within the "A_Exploring" folder, I've experimented with code, made enhancements, and played with Python modules.

### Software Development Project

Behold my debut project - a Help Desk Ticketing System, where I've applied Pythonic principles and showcased creative solutions.

## How to Navigate
